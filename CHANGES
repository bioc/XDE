v1.3.13
- Moved gtools from Suggests to Imports
- Removed multiple instance of 'f' function in ExpressionSetList[ method

v1.5.3
- Corrected bug in zeroNu function (needed to pass one.delta argument
  to empiricalStart function)
- fixed bug in reading acceptance  and potential for XdeMCMC objects

v1.5.4
- added burnin argument to calculatePosteriorAvg function

v1.5.5
- For parameters indexed by genes and platforms, the chains were read in incorrectly
	## - The order of the vector for parameter nu_gp indexed by gene g and study p is
	##     nu_11, nu_12, ..., nu_1P, nu_21, ..., nu_2P, nu_G1, ..., nu_GP
	##
	## Arrays:  the 'left subscript moves the fastest'
	##Therefore
	##  mcmc <- array(mcmc, dim=c(# iterations, # genes, # studies)) is equiv to
	## For iteration 1:
	## mcmc[1, 1, 1] <- nu_11
	## mcmc[1, 1, 2] <- nu_12
	## mcmc[1, 1, P] <- nu_1P
	## mcmc[1, 2, 1] <- nu_21
	## mcmc[1, 2, P] <- nu_2P
